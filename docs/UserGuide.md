# GoodMatch

## **Overview**

GoodMatch (GM) is a **desktop app for managing applicants and job listings, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI), specifically catering to HR managers in charge of tracking job listings across many platforms. If you can type fast, GM can get your applicant and job listing management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be **supplied by the user**. E.g. in `add t/TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `add t/Chicken Rice Uncle`.


- Items in square brackets are **optional**. E.g. `t/TITLE [a/APPLICANT]...` can be used as `t/Chicken Rice Uncle a/John Tan` or as `t/Chicken Rice Uncle`.


- Items with `…` after them can be used **multiple times** including **zero times**. E.g. `[a/APPLICANT]…` can be used as `` (i.e. 0 times), `a/applicant1`, `a/applicant2 a/application3` etc.


- Parameters can be in **any order**. E.g. if the command specifies `t/TITLE d/DESCRIPTION`, `d/DESCRIPTION t/TITLE` is also acceptable.


- If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the **last occurrence** of the parameter will be taken. E.g. if you specify `t/Chicken Rice Uncle t/Chicken Rice Auntie`, only `t/Chicken Rice Auntie` will be taken.


- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `view` and `exit`) will be **ignored**. E.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
